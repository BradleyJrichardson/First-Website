Hi. My name is Brad.  

I am a current coderAcademy student,  

I have a passion for everything cooking, brewing, fermenting, creating. I've written a few recipe books to collate my formulations.  

Total mind and body health is very important to me and I practice yoga, meditation and resistance training.  

Personal growth drives me, growth mindset. This career is so fulfilling as every day I am learning and getting better 

I appreciate how technology is augmenting the human experience, I am in awe as I watch the landscape develop and experiences become more better.  

What really lights me up is doing natural behaviors, whether it be walking in some grass without shoes on, or cooking a freshly caught fish over a fire. I try to balance my life with these activities. 

My last occupation put the world in perspective for me, mindless work for 8+ hours everyday. I occupied my mind with books and podcasts that were life-changing.
